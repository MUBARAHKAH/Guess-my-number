# Guess My Number Game

## Overview
The **"Guess My Number"** game is a simple JavaScript-based game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player, telling them if their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in JavaScript.

## Project Structure
This project contains the following key components:

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file used for styling the game interface.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic and user interaction.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number within a given range (e.g., 1-100).
- **User Input**: The player inputs their guess through a form.
- **Feedback**: The game tells the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Attempts Tracker**: Tracks how many attempts the player has made.
- **Game Reset**: After the player guesses correctly, the game can be reset with a new random number.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game and creating an interactive user experience.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, including random number generation, input validation, and feedback to the player.
